## Description of OCPL folders structure

### Inspirations and assumptions

 - The idea of PHP universal structure of project: [https://github.com/php-pds/skeleton](https://github.com/php-pds/skeleton)
 - OCPL needs some cleanup

### Folders structure: root-level folders
### `/` (project root folder)
- **access**: NO access for webserver (PHP not allowed)
- finally it contains only:
	- README.md
	- LICENSE.txt
	- .htaccess
	- .gitignore
- **migration**: all scripts from here will be temporary migrated to `/public`, but finally should be refactored to controllers  

### `/bin/` 
- **access**: NO access for webserver (PHP not allowed) - only command line
 - root-level directory for command-line executable files
 - **migration:**  contains scripts which are used ONLY from command-line - now OCPL has such in :
	 - `/ci`
	 - `/util.sec`
	 - ...?

### `/config/`
- **access**: NO access from Internet, PHP allowed
- root-level directory for configuration files
- contains ONLY config files (PHP) 
- **migration**: current `/Config` will be just renamed to `/config` + config scripts needs to be fixed

### `/docs/`
- **access**: NO access for webserver (PHP not allowed)
- root-level directory for documentation files
- all doc files should be in markdown if possible

### `/public/`
- **access**: NO access for webserver (PHP not allowed) - only command line
- root-level directory for web server files
- this folder contains in generally: 
	- index.php - the only PHP (dynamic) file here
	- JS files 
	- hosted JS libs (like tinyMCE)
	- CSSes
	- other STATIC files
- folder structure - check below 

### `/resources/`
- **access**: RW for webserver, PHP not allowed
- a root-level directory for other resource files

### `/src/`
- **access**: No access from Internet, PHP allowed
- a root-level directory for PHP source code files
